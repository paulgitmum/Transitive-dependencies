# Transitive-dependencies

### What are transitive dependencies ?
A component may have two different kinds of dependencies
 1. Direct dependencies 
 -<i>  are directly required by the component. A direct dependency is also referred to as a first level dependency </i>
 2. Transitive dependencies 
  -<i>  dependencies that your component needs, but only because another dependency needs them. </i>
